# Touka-Bot

**Who is Touka?**
Touka is a work in progress chat bot for Discord done in discord.js designed to work as a guide and helped around a server for the mobile game Crash Fever. This bot is built as a hobby in my spare time.  

**What features does Touka currently have?**

Features are included through commands that have to be sent in chat. Majority of these need updates to bring them up to date with the current state of the game: 
       
        -  >welcome 
        Provides welcome message introducing Touka in a message.
        -  >commands
        Provides a list of available commands to use
        -  >unitinfo [insert unit name] (red units need updating, blue/green/yellow to be added)
        Returns info for that particular unit printed in a neat format. 
        -  >unitpic [insert unit name] (same as above)
        Returns a picture of how the unit looks like. This picture doesn't include the full unit page with it's info. 
        -  >maxbug [insert gimmick name] [insert color name] (needs updating for all gimmicks with new units)
        Returns a picture (currently) of farmable units that have a particular gimmick.
        -  .embed [insert unit name] (just started)
        Admin only command to send RichEmbeds that include well formatted sections with links to gathered turn by turn guides for a particular quest. 
        
**What features are planned for Touka?** 

        -  maxbug command update: create my own max bug by gimmick chart that is easily updated and doesn't require new pictures to be cropped and added manually
        -  joinlfg/leave lfg command update: create a command letting a user select a specific role for themselves. This tag is currently LFG (Looking for group). After functionality is made working potentially expand to have a few different roles for currently live quests.
        -  Touka responding at certain trigger events outside of commands (such as someone mentioning the name "Touka" in their message)
        -  current quests duration command
        -  current event info command
        -  next duck hunt command
        -  claim waifu/husbando command
        -  build your own mini unit database of units owned, gain score per unit (early idea)
